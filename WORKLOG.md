# Work log

A running record of completed work and open follow-ups, so a fresh Claude Code
session (which always starts with no memory of past sessions) can catch up fast
and we never redo something that's already done.

**How to use it**
- Newest entry on top.
- One block per task: what changed, why, the PR, and anything still pending.
- At the end of a task, say "log it" (or Claude adds an entry as part of finishing)
  and commit the change together with the work.
- A SessionStart hook prints the top of this file automatically at the start of
  every session — see `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`.

## 2026-08-07 · Phase 2 stock-release: Engineer can approve too (alongside Plant Manager)
- **Change (owner-approved, frozen Phase 2):** The "For stock release" approval gate
  on a from-stock order now accepts the **Engineer** base role in addition to the
  Plant Manager (and admin). Requested explicitly by the owner.
- **Where:** server gate `approveStockRelease` in `src/app/(app)/orders/actions.ts`
  (added `user.role === "ENGINEER"`), UI gate `canApprove` in
  `src/app/(app)/orders/[id]/page.tsx`, and the wording in
  `src/app/(app)/orders/[id]/stock-release.tsx` ("Awaiting Plant Manager or Engineer
  approval…").
- **Note:** "Engineer" is a base app role (SALES/ENGINEER/ADMIN), not a workflow role —
  hence `user.role === "ENGINEER"`, not a `WorkflowRoleKey` check.
- **Pending:** none.

## 2026-08-07 · Purchasing draft-PO no longer wiped by auto-refresh — PR #239 (merged)
- **Bug:** In the Purchaser role, building a combined PO could lose everything
  typed (lines, quantities, prices, ticked requests, supplier/EWT details) the
  moment a notification arrived.
- **Cause:** The draft lived only in React state. The Purchasing page auto-refreshes
  every 8s and on window focus; when another user acted on a pending request (the
  event that fires the notification), it dropped out of the recomputed list, which
  unmounted the draft form. No server-side deletion was involved.
- **Fix:** Snapshot the selected requests into state when the build starts and drive
  the form from that snapshot; keep the builder mounted while building; keep the
  combine workspace mounted on the builder tab even when the pending list momentarily
  empties. Files: `src/app/(app)/purchasing/combined-purchasing.tsx`,
  `src/app/(app)/purchasing/purchasing-workspace.tsx` (frozen Phase 4 — changed only
  to fix the reported bug).
- **Pending:** Optional follow-up — pause the auto-refresh while a PO form is open,
  so the list can't shift under an active edit at all.

## 2026-08-07 · Purchaser can delete stock items — PR #238 (merged)
- Added a delete control for stock items in the Purchaser role.
- **Pending:** none.
