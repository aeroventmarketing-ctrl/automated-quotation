# Work log

A running record of completed work and open follow-ups, so a fresh Claude Code
session (which always starts with no memory of past sessions) can catch up fast
and we never redo something that's already done.

**How to use it**
- Newest entry on top.
- One block per task: what changed, why, the PR, and anything still pending.
- At the end of a task, say "log it" (or Claude adds an entry as part of finishing)
  and commit the change together with the work.
- A SessionStart hook prints the top of this file automatically at the start of
  every session — see `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`.

## 2026-08-07 · Approval alarm + dashboard now deep-link to the pending phase
- **Feature (owner-requested):** Tapping the flashing "Approval needed" pop-up now
  navigates straight to the order, scrolled to the pending phase card — instead of
  just silencing. My Dashboard's pending order tasks link to the same phase anchor.
- **Behaviour (per owner):** the pop-up auto-jumps to a single order (the most recent
  of those waiting) via a "Go to order {code}" button; other waiting orders are noted
  ("+N more — see My Dashboard"). A separate "Dismiss" button (and tapping outside /
  any key) silences without navigating.
- **Where:**
  - `src/lib/order-workflow.ts` — new `phaseAnchor(stage)` → "phase-1|2|5" (order
    stages only ever sit in Phase 1/2/5).
  - `src/lib/pending-approvals.ts` — `PendingApproval` gained `anchor`; the API
    (`/api/pending-approvals`) passes it through.
  - `src/components/approver-alarm.tsx` — navigation on tap (useRouter), Escape /
    backdrop = dismiss, card tap doesn't dismiss.
  - `src/app/(app)/orders/[id]/page.tsx` — `id="phase-1|2|5"` + `scroll-mt-24` on the
    Phase 1 / 2 / 5 cards (anchor targets; frozen cards, presentational only).
  - `src/lib/my-dashboard.ts` — order task `href` now includes `#phase-N`.
- **Notes:** hash-scroll uses the app's existing pattern (e.g. `/inventory#inv-items`).
  Multi-batch Phase 5 orders fall back to the top of the order page (no separate anchor).
- **Pending:** none.

## 2026-08-07 · Engineer stock-release approval limited to duct hardware (refines #241)
- **Change (owner-approved, frozen Phase 2):** #241 let an Engineer approve ANY from-stock
  release. Per owner, restrict that: an Engineer may approve only when every from-stock line
  is in-house duct hardware — **Duct Angle corner, TDC Cleat, S-clip, C-clip**. If the order
  has any Office-supplied resale stock (AlphaAir, Vent Cap), only the Plant Manager (or admin)
  may approve. Plant Manager/admin still approve everything.
- **New helper:** `isDuctHardwareStockOnly(items)` in `src/lib/department-pnl.ts` — true when
  all from-stock lines classify as `isDuctHardware` (reuses the existing classifiers).
- **Where:** server gate `approveStockRelease` (`actions.ts`) now loads items first and gates
  the Engineer on `isDuctHardwareStockOnly` (clear error otherwise); UI `canApprove` +
  `engineerEligible` wording on the Phase 2 card (`page.tsx`, `stock-release.tsx`); and
  `pendingStep(wf, stockOnly, engineerApprovesStock)` gained a 3rd flag so the `engineer`
  approver flag (banner / dashboard / alarm) is set only for duct-hardware-only orders. All
  four `pendingStep` callers updated (`orders/[id]/page.tsx`, `orders/page.tsx`,
  `my-dashboard.ts`, `pending-approvals.ts`).
- **Pending:** none.

## 2026-08-07 · "Waiting for" for from-stock orders now routes to Warehouse, not the PO step
- **Bug:** On a from-stock order, the Phase 2 "WAITING FOR / APPROVERS" banner (and the
  order-list hint, My Dashboard tasks, and approval alarms) showed "Prepare & process the
  Purchase Order — Purchaser / Technical Head". A from-stock order has no PO; it's released
  from stock by the Warehouse. So the wrong roles were shown and alarmed.
- **Cause:** `pendingStep(wf)` in `src/lib/order-workflow.ts` only saw job-order content;
  a from-stock order has none, so it was treated as bought-in (the PO path). It couldn't
  tell stock-only from bought-in because that distinction lives in the quotation lines.
- **Fix (owner-approved, touches frozen Phase 1/2 routing — display only, no stage/gate
  change):** `pendingStep(wf, stockOnly)` gained an optional flag. For a stock-only order at
  the `released` stage it now returns: not-yet-approved → "Approve stock release" (Plant
  Manager or Engineer), approved → "Release from stock" (Warehouse / Fans & Blowers head).
  Added an `engineer` flag to `PendingStep` (mirrors `sales`). All four callers pass the
  flag and honour the engineer owner: `orders/[id]/page.tsx`, `orders/page.tsx`,
  `src/lib/my-dashboard.ts`, `src/lib/pending-approvals.ts` (the last two now include
  quotation `items` to detect stock-only).
- **Pending:** none.

## 2026-08-07 · Phase 2 stock-release: Engineer can approve too (alongside Plant Manager)
- **Change (owner-approved, frozen Phase 2):** The "For stock release" approval gate
  on a from-stock order now accepts the **Engineer** base role in addition to the
  Plant Manager (and admin). Requested explicitly by the owner.
- **Where:** server gate `approveStockRelease` in `src/app/(app)/orders/actions.ts`
  (added `user.role === "ENGINEER"`), UI gate `canApprove` in
  `src/app/(app)/orders/[id]/page.tsx`, and the wording in
  `src/app/(app)/orders/[id]/stock-release.tsx` ("Awaiting Plant Manager or Engineer
  approval…").
- **Note:** "Engineer" is a base app role (SALES/ENGINEER/ADMIN), not a workflow role —
  hence `user.role === "ENGINEER"`, not a `WorkflowRoleKey` check.
- **Pending:** none.

## 2026-08-07 · Purchasing draft-PO no longer wiped by auto-refresh — PR #239 (merged)
- **Bug:** In the Purchaser role, building a combined PO could lose everything
  typed (lines, quantities, prices, ticked requests, supplier/EWT details) the
  moment a notification arrived.
- **Cause:** The draft lived only in React state. The Purchasing page auto-refreshes
  every 8s and on window focus; when another user acted on a pending request (the
  event that fires the notification), it dropped out of the recomputed list, which
  unmounted the draft form. No server-side deletion was involved.
- **Fix:** Snapshot the selected requests into state when the build starts and drive
  the form from that snapshot; keep the builder mounted while building; keep the
  combine workspace mounted on the builder tab even when the pending list momentarily
  empties. Files: `src/app/(app)/purchasing/combined-purchasing.tsx`,
  `src/app/(app)/purchasing/purchasing-workspace.tsx` (frozen Phase 4 — changed only
  to fix the reported bug).
- **Pending:** Optional follow-up — pause the auto-refresh while a PO form is open,
  so the list can't shift under an active edit at all.

## 2026-08-07 · Purchaser can delete stock items — PR #238 (merged)
- Added a delete control for stock items in the Purchaser role.
- **Pending:** none.
